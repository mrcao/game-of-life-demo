# Changes and Fixes Applied

## Bug Fixes

### 1. ✅ Grid Resizing Bug (IndexError)
**Problem**: After resizing the grid, clicking play/randomize/noise caused `IndexError: list index out of range`

**Root Cause**: The resize function only updated `grid.grid` array but not `grid.cfg.rows` and `grid.cfg.cols`, causing mismatches between the grid data and its configuration.

**Fix**: Complete rewrite of `on_gridsize_change()` to:
- Create a new `LifeGrid` object with proper dimensions
- Copy the center region from old grid to new grid
- Update all global variables (`grid_size`, `cell_size`, `grid`, `monitor`)
- Properly maintain animation state during resize

### 2. ✅ Play/Pause State Management
**Problem**: Play button didn't work well after pausing; state management was unreliable

**Fix**: 
- Merged play and pause into single `toggle_play_pause()` function
- Added proper state tracking with `running` global variable
- Clear timer properly on pause
- Check running state in loop to prevent zombie timers

### 3. ✅ Module Import Error (CLI)
**Problem**: Running `python3 examples/cli.py` failed with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'life'`

**Fix**: Added path manipulation to `cli.py`:
```python
sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent))
```

## UI/UX Improvements

### 4. ✅ Single Play/Pause Toggle Button
**Before**: Separate Play and Pause buttons

**After**: Single button that toggles between states with visual feedback:
- **Green** when playing: "⏸ Pause"
- **Gray** when paused: "▶ Play"  
- **Dark gray** when grid is dead: "⏸ Paused (Grid Dead)"
- Smooth transitions with CSS

### 5. ✅ Inverted Speed Slider
**Before**: Sliding right increased ms (felt slower)

**After**: Sliding right = faster (lower ms)
- Right = "Very Fast" (10ms)
- Left = "Very Slow" (600ms)
- Friendly labels: "Speed: Very Fast/Fast/Medium/Slow/Very Slow"

### 6. ✅ Grid Size Instead of Cell Size
**Before**: "Cell Size" slider changed pixel size (6-18px), unintuitive

**After**: "Grid Size" slider changes grid dimensions (20×20 to 120×120)
- More intuitive: directly control how many cells
- Cell size automatically calculated to fit canvas
- Label shows "60×60" format

### 7. ✅ Auto-Seed on Play
**Behavior**: When pressing Play on an empty/dead grid, automatically randomizes with current density setting

**Benefit**: No need to manually click "Randomize" → "Play"

### 8. ✅ Auto-Pause on Death
**Behavior**: When all cells die during animation, automatically:
- Pause the simulation
- Update button to "dead" state (dark gray)
- Prevent wasted CPU cycles

**Manual Check**: Also updates button state when:
- Clicking cells
- Using Step
- Randomizing
- Injecting noise
- Clearing grid

## Technical Improvements

### 9. ✅ Proper State Synchronization
- All functions now call `update_button_state()` after grid changes
- Button appearance always reflects actual grid/animation state
- No more desynced UI states

### 10. ✅ Robust Grid Resizing
- Pauses animation during resize
- Copies center region from old grid (preserves patterns when possible)
- Resumes animation after resize if it was running
- Resets pattern monitor to avoid false cycle detection

### 11. ✅ Better Global Variable Management
All globals properly declared and updated:
- `grid_size`, `cell_size`: Physical dimensions
- `grid`: The LifeGrid object itself
- `monitor`: Pattern detection
- `running`, `timer_id`: Animation state
- `speed_ms`, `density`: User settings

## CSS Enhancements

Added button state classes:
```css
.play-btn.playing { background:#28a745; border-color:#34ce57 }  /* Green */
.play-btn.paused { background:#6c757d; border-color:#868e96 }   /* Gray */
.play-btn.dead { background:#4a4a4a; cursor: not-allowed; opacity: 0.6 }  /* Dark */
```

## Testing Recommendations

Test these scenarios to verify all fixes:

1. **Resize Test**:
   - Create pattern → Resize grid → Click play
   - Should work without errors

2. **Play/Pause Test**:
   - Play → Pause → Play → Pause
   - Should toggle smoothly with color changes

3. **Dead Grid Test**:
   - Clear grid → Click Play
   - Should auto-seed and start

4. **Death Detection Test**:
   - Create small unstable pattern → Play → Wait for death
   - Should auto-pause with dark button

5. **Speed Test**:
   - Slide speed slider right
   - Should get faster (not slower)

6. **Grid Size Test**:
   - Slide grid size → Various operations
   - All functions should work at any grid size

## Files Modified

- `docs/index.html` - UI structure and CSS
- `docs/app.py` - Complete rewrite with all fixes
- `examples/cli.py` - Import path fix

## Performance Notes

- Grid sizes above 100×100 may slow down in browser (PyScript limitation)
- Optimal range: 40×40 to 80×80 for smooth animation
- Cell rendering is O(n²) where n = grid_size
